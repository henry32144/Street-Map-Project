How to use
==============================
Open index.html, and the application will try to get the current location of user.

If success, the application will show sushi restaurants around the user in range of 1000m.

And if fail, will show the default coordinate which locate in Taipei city.

Future plan
==============================
Maybe will add function like sorting by rates, or sorting by price.
